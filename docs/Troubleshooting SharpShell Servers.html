<p><strong>Troubleshooting SharpShell Servers</strong></p>
<p>Creating Shell Extension Servers can be extremely difficult, as diagnosing issues is very hard. The most common problem encountered is that a server seems to work with the ServerManager tool, but simply doesn't show up at all in Windows Explorer. This page
 pulls together a detailed guide of how to troubleshoot servers.</p>
<p><strong>My Server Doesn't Show Up in Windows Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most common issue. Here are the things to try, in order.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that your server class has the [ComVisbile(true)] attribute. </li><li>Make sure that your assembly is COM Visible (Project Properties &gt; Application &gt; Assembly Information... 'Make assembly COM-visible'.
</li><li>If you are on Windows 32 bit, make sure you register the server with the x86 version of regasm:<br>
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\regasm&nbsp; </li><li>If you are on Windows 64 bit, make sure you register the server with the x64 version of regasm:<br>
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\regasm </li><li>If you are registering a server that is NOT installed in the GAC, make sure you use the '/codebase' flag for regasm.<br>
regasm MyServer.dll /register /codebase </li><li><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;For most SharpShell servers to work on anything other than a development machine, they MUST be built in Release Mode against the Release Mode SharpShell binary. This binary uses an unmanaged C&#43;&#43; component that has a dependency
 to MSVCRTD100.dll in debug mode - this will NOT be present on none-development machines.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Shell Thumbnail Handlers</strong></p>
<p>Shell thumbnail handlers have some specific things to be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do NOT use 'ClassOfExtension' COM server associations - you must register to a file extension.
</li><li>The Server Manager tool doesn't seem to respect alpha channels, but the system does.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Shell Icon Overlay Handlers</strong></p>
<p>If you are not seeing your Shell Icon Overlay handlers after registering, double check which other icon handlers are registered, if you have more than a few then yours may not show up - the system only supports about ten.</p>
<p>On 32 bit systems, it normally takes a restart if explorer.exe for the icon to be loaded. Apparently, this can actually be done programatically via SHChangeNotify.</p>
<p>If you see a cross icon instead of your icon, make sure the build action for the icon is set to&nbsp;&quot;Resource&quot;. If this doesn't work, try copying it to the resource folder manually. (See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/545781/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Icon-Overlay-Handlers?msg=4972010#xx4972010xx">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/545781/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Icon-Overlay-Handlers?msg=4972010#xx4972010xx</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Shell Property Sheet Extensions</strong></p>
<p>For property sheet extensions to work, make sure that the destination machine has the Visual C&#43;&#43; 2012 Redistributables installed (vcredist_x86 or vcredist_x64).</p>
<p>It seems that under some circumstances, Tab Controls in property sheet extensions can lead to unpredictable behaviour and crashes - currently I recommend against using them until the route cause of this issue is identified. More detail on this issue and
 the one above can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://sharpshell.codeplex.com/discussions/470807">https://sharpshell.codeplex.com/discussions/470807</a></p>
<p><strong>Context Menu Extensions</strong></p>
<p>It seems that sometimes creating the [ComServerAssociation] is not enough.&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10pt">When you add the registry key for the given extension, the context menu may be got from a different part of the registry for the users preference.
 For example, for 'png', u</span><span style="font-size:10pt">ou can determine this by checking the user choice:</span></p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts.png\UserChoice&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This will give you the progid gives you the keyname to associate with the server. In this case, it might be WindowsLive.PhotoGallery.png.16.4.<br>
<br>
I did this manually and hey presto it works.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preview Handlers</strong></p>
<p>If you find your preview handler for Directories is not working on a client machine, trying installing and registering it both&nbsp;<strong>both&nbsp;</strong>x86 and x64. Thanks

<p><strong>The File Type Verifier</strong></p>
<p>The File Type Verifier tool from Microsoft can also be used to get some diagnostic reports on Shell Extensions associated with file types.
